# My Favorites!

* Today is a great day!  I am learning many things at Epicodus and even though they have thrown a lot my way, I feel like I am embarking on an incredible journey full of opportunity!

If you must make me pick a favorite food it would be Tacos!  I can eat tacos everyday and always try something new!

By far and away my favorite travel destination thus far has been Thailand!  The people are simply amazing and how can you not talk about the food!!  I would live there given the opportunity.
